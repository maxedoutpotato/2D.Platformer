Main character is a Doge Samuray who needs help in overcoming obstacles in his daily training path.
2D project, where I experiment with drawing animation in a game. The character will run, jump, slide and hit through obstacles.
All assets and animations are drawn by hand with a digital tablet. 
For me the projects goal is to study and see how will the main character animation behave and work with transitions.
The game will look like a black and white cartoon with colored elements/fx, also will focus on japanese aesthetics and music.
